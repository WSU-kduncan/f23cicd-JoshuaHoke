            <span><em>Bonsai</em> is the ART of GROWING <strong>miniature trees</strong> in pots. There's a lot more to it than that though. Techniques such as carefully restricting but not abandoning fertilizers, pruning and wiring branches, and pinching buds are used to limit and control or redirect healthy growth. <em>It is an art and a science</em> requiring care and patience.</span> <span id="conceal">Bonsai is <em>of</em> nature, but not found growing <em>in</em> nature. The art form known as Bonsai (in Japanese, the word "Bonsai" literally translates to "planted in a container") has existed and evolved in many forms for <strong>well over a millenium</strong>. Having originated in China, it later crossed the sea to the shores of Japan with Buddhist students who had made the perilous journey to China in the sixth century CE. With periodic innovations over the centuries and an increasing availability of expertise and materials, as well as the proliferation of many annual events and conventions on the local, national, and international levels, the ancient Japanese art of Bonsai has not only survived but flourished as an art form, a discipline, and even as a contemplative path to inner peace and harmony with the beauty of nature.</span>
